## The problem

Research labs contain hundreds, if not thousands, of supplies and equipment. There are many instances where researchers are working on an important experiment only to realize they’ve run out of a crucial reagent. This happens often because it is difficult to keep track of all of the supplies and reagents within a lab.

## The solution

Storeroom is a lab supply management application that makes it easier to track and manage everything within a lab. This way, scientists can focus more on the science, and less on the logistics.
